59.9	Surface	Surface	In mathematics, specifically in topology, a surface is a two-dimensional topological manifold. The most familiar examples are those that arise as the boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 — for example, the surface of a ball. On the other hand, there are surfaces, such as the Klein bottle, that cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space without introducing singularities or self-intersections.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Saddle_pt.jpg/225px-Saddle_pt.jpg
