95.2	Seed	Seed	A seed is a small embryonic plant enclosed in a covering called the seed coat, usually with some stored food. It is the product of the ripened ovule of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants which occurs after fertilization and some growth within the mother plant. The formation of the seed completes the process of reproduction in seed plants (started with the development of flowers and pollination), with the embryo developed from the zygote and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Brown_Flax_Seeds.jpg/300px-Brown_Flax_Seeds.jpg
