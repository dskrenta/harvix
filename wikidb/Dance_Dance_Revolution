214.7	Dance_Dance_Revolution	Dance Dance Revolution	Dance Dance Revolution, abbreviated DDR, and previously known as Dancing Stage in Europe and Australasia, is a music video game series produced by Konami. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/Dance_Dance_Revolution_logo_2009.png/250px-Dance_Dance_Revolution_logo_2009.png
