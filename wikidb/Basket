27.03	Basket	Basket	A basket is a container which is traditionally constructed from stiff fibres, which can be made from a range of materials, including wood splints, runners, and cane. While most baskets are made from plant materials, other materials such as horsehair, baleen, or metal wire can be used. Baskets are generally woven by hand. Some baskets are fitted with a lid, others are left open.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Dupuis%2C_Pierre_-_Basket_of_Plums.jpg/240px-Dupuis%2C_Pierre_-_Basket_of_Plums.jpg
