1.11	Artistic_movement	Art movement	An art movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in modern art, when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Lascaux2.jpg/130px-Lascaux2.jpg
