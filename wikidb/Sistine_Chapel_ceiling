66.5	Sistine_Chapel_ceiling	Sistine Chapel ceiling	Pope Julius II was a "warrior pope" who in his papacy undertook an aggressive campaign for political control, to unite and empower Italy under the leadership of the Church. He invested in symbolism to display his temporal power such as his procession, in the Classical manner, through a triumphal arch in a chariot after one of his many military victories. It was Julius who began the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in 1506, as the most potent symbol of the source of papal power.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Hands_of_God_and_Adam.jpg/300px-Hands_of_God_and_Adam.jpg
