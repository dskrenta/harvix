42.27	I-35W_Mississippi_River_Bridge	I-35W Mississippi River bridge	The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially known as Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it suddenly collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's fifth busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely cause of the collapse, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge at the time of the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/I35W_Bridge.jpg/250px-I35W_Bridge.jpg
