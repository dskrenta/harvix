112.6	Compound_interest	Compound interest	Compound interest arises when interest is added to the principal, so that, from that moment on, the interest that has been added also earns interest. This addition of interest to the principal is called compounding. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with 1000 initial principal and 20% interest per year would have a balance of 1200 at the end of the first year, 1440 at the end of the second year, and so on.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Compound_Interest_with_Varying_Frequencies.svg/350px-Compound_Interest_with_Varying_Frequencies.svg.png
