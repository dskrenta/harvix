61.7	Tin_Woodman	Tin Woodman	The Tin Woodman, sometimes referred to as the Tin Man or the Tin Woodsman (the third name appears only in adaptations, the first—and in rare instances, the second—was used by Baum), is a character in the fictional Land of Oz created by American author L. Frank Baum. Baum's Tin Woodman first appeared in his classic 1900 book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and reappeared in many other Oz books. In late 19th century America, men made out of various tin pieces were used in advertising and political cartoons. Baum, who was editing a magazine on decorating shop windows when he wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was reportedly inspired to invent the Tin Woodman by a figure he had built out of metal parts for a shop display.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Tin_Woodman.png/200px-Tin_Woodman.png
