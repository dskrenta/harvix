145.9	Digital	Digital	A digital system is a data technology that uses discrete (discontinuous) values. By contrast, non-digital (or analog) systems use a continuous range of values to represent information. Although digital representations are discrete, the information represented can be either discrete, such as numbers, letters or computer icons, or continuous, such as sounds, images, and other measurements of continuous systems.
