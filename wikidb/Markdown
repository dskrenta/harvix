148.8	Markdown	Markdown	Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)". The language takes many cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in email.
