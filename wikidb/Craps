88.3	Craps	Craps	Craps is a dice game in which the players make wagers on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice. Players may wager money against each other (street craps, also known as shooting dice or rolling dice) or a bank (casino craps, also known as table craps). Because it requires little equipment, street craps can be played in informal settings.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Craps.jpg/350px-Craps.jpg
