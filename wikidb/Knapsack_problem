56.0	Knapsack_problem	Knapsack problem	The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the count of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most useful items.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Knapsack.svg/250px-Knapsack.svg.png
