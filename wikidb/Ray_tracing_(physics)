7.20	Ray_tracing_(physics)	Ray tracing (physics)	Ray tracing works by assuming that the particle or wave can be modeled as a large number of very narrow beams , and that there exists some distance, possibly very small, over which such a ray is locally straight. The ray tracer will advance the ray over this distance, and then use a local derivative of the medium to calculate the ray's new direction. From this location, a new ray is sent out and the process is repeated until a complete path is generated. If the simulation includes solid objects, the ray may be tested for intersection with them at each step, making adjustments to the ray's direction if a collision is found. Other properties of the ray may be altered as the simulation advances as well, such as intensity, wavelength, or polarization. The process is repeated with as many rays as are necessary to understand the behavior of the system.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Raytrace_changing_refractive_index.svg/300px-Raytrace_changing_refractive_index.svg.png
