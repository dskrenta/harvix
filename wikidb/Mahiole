3.60	Mahiole	Mahiole	Hawaiian feather helmets, known as mahiole in the Hawaiian language, were worn with feather cloaks (ʻahu ʻula). These were symbols of the highest rank reserved for the men of the alii, the chiefly class of Hawaii. There are examples of this traditional headgear in museums around the world. At least sixteen of these helmets were collected during the voyages of Captain Cook. These helmets are made from a woven frame structure decorated with bird feathers and are examples of fine featherwork techniques. One of these helmets was included in a painting of Cook's death by Johann Zoffany.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/%27Man_Wearing_Feather_Cloak_and_Helmit%27%2C_oil_on_canvas_painting_attributed_to_Rembrandt_Peale.jpg/220px-%27Man_Wearing_Feather_Cloak_and_Helmit%27%2C_oil_on_canvas_painting_attributed_to_Rembrandt_Peale.jpg
