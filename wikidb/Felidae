63.7	Felidae	Felidae	Felidae is the biological family of the cats; a member of this family is called a felid. Felids are the strictest carnivores of the thirteen terrestrial families in the order Carnivora, although the three families of marine mammals comprising the superfamily pinnipedia are as carnivorous as the felids. The most familiar felid is the domestic cat, which first became associated with humans about 10,000 years ago, but the family includes all other wild cats including the big cats.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Tiger-zoologie.de0001_22.JPG/220px-Tiger-zoologie.de0001_22.JPG
