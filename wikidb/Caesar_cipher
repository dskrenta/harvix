125.6	Caesar_cipher	Caesar cipher	In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as a Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Caesar3.svg/320px-Caesar3.svg.png
