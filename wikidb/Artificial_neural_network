122.7	Artificial_neural_network	Artificial neural network	An artificial neural network (ANN), usually called neural network (NN), is a mathematical model or computational model that is inspired by the structure and/or functional aspects of biological neural networks. A neural network consists of an interconnected group of artificial neurons, and it processes information using a connectionist approach to computation. In most cases an ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network during the learning phase. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Artificial_neural_network.svg/350px-Artificial_neural_network.svg.png
