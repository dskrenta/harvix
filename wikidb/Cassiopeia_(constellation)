51.4	Cassiopeia_(constellation)	Cassiopeia (constellation)	Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the vain queen Cassiopeia in Greek mythology, who boasted about her unrivalled beauty. Cassiopeia was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'W' shape, formed by five bright stars. It is bordered by Andromeda to the south, Perseus to the southeast, and Cepheus to the north. She is opposite the Big Dipper, and from northern latitudes can be seen at her clearest in early November.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Cassiopeia_IAU.svg/250px-Cassiopeia_IAU.svg.png
