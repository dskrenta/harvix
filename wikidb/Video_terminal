1.00	Video_terminal	Computer terminal	A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a computing system. Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched cards or paper tape for input, but as the technology improved and video displays were introduced, terminals pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry. A related development was timesharing systems, which evolved in parallel and made up for any inefficiencies of the user's typing ability with the ability to support multiple users on the same machine, each at their own terminal.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/ASR-33_1.jpg/220px-ASR-33_1.jpg
