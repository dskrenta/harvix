63.7	Abstract_factory_pattern	Abstract factory pattern	The abstract factory pattern is a software design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. In normal usage, the client software creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interfaces to create the concrete objects that are part of the theme. The client does not know (or care) which concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories since it uses only the generic interfaces of their products. This pattern separates the details of implementation of a set of objects from their general usage.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Abstract_Factory_in_LePUS3.png
