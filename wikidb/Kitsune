63.5	Kitsune	Kitsune	Foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Prince_Hanzoku_terrorised_by_a_nine-_tailed_fox.jpg/220px-Prince_Hanzoku_terrorised_by_a_nine-_tailed_fox.jpg
