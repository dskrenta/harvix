2.00	Ursula_Werner	Ursula Werner	Ursula Werner is a German actress born September 28, 1943 in Eberswalde, Germany. She grew up in the Prenzlauer Berg district of Berlin. After studying at the Staatlichen Schauspielschule Berlin (Berlin State Drama College), she obtained her first roles in the Halle Opera House, and in the Berlin cabaret "Die Distel". From 1974 to 2009 Werner was a permanent member of the Maxim-Gorki-Theater in Berlin. She also makes guest appearances on the Gorki stage. She is particularly remembered for her role of Dr. Unglaube in the 1977 film Ein irrer Duft von frischem Heu (A Terrific Scent of Fresh Hay). From 2001 to 2007 she played a permanent secondary character in the Schloss Einstein series. Following several minor roles in film and on TV, she took the leading role for Andreas Dresen's Wolke 9 where she played the part of a woman in her late sixties who leaves her older husband for an even older man. The film attempts to show that even in advanced years, love and sex simply do not just stop. For this unusual role, Werner received the 2009 German Film Award (Lola) for the best female leading role.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Ursula_Werner.JPG/220px-Ursula_Werner.JPG
