168.7	Project_Chanology	Project Chanology	Project Chanology (also called Operation Chanology) is a protest movement against the practices of the Church of Scientology by members of Anonymous, a leaderless Internet-based group that defines itself as ubiquitous. The project was started in response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with Scientologist Tom Cruise from the Internet in January 2008.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Anonymous_Scientology_1_by_David_Shankbone.JPG/300px-Anonymous_Scientology_1_by_David_Shankbone.JPG
