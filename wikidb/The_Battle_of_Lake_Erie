1.00	The_Battle_of_Lake_Erie	Battle of Lake Erie	The Battle of Lake Erie, sometimes called the Battle of Put-in-Bay, was fought on 10 September 1813, in Lake Erie off the coast of Ohio during the War of 1812. Nine vessels of the United States Navy defeated and captured six vessels of Great Britain's Royal Navy. This ensured American control of the lake for the rest of the war, which in turn allowed the Americans to recover Detroit and win the Battle of the Thames to break the Indian confederation of Tecumseh. It was one of the biggest naval battles of the War of 1812.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Battle_erie.jpg/300px-Battle_erie.jpg
