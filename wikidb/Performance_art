89.8	Performance_art	Performance art	In art, performance art is a performance presented to an audience, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/ZoneImmaterielKlein2.jpg/170px-ZoneImmaterielKlein2.jpg
