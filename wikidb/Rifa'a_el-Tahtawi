He founded the School of Languages in 1835 and was influential in the development of science, law, literature and Egyptology in 19th-century Egypt. His work influenced that of many later scholars including Muhammad Abduh.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Tahtawi.jpg/120px-Tahtawi.jpg
