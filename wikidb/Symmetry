66.8	Symmetry	Symmetry	Symmetry (from Greek συμμετρεῖν symmetría "measure together") generally conveys two primary meanings. The first is an imprecise sense of harmonious or aesthetically pleasing proportionality and balance; such that it reflects beauty or perfection. The second meaning is a precise and well-defined concept of balance or "patterned self-similarity" that can be demonstrated or proved according to the rules of a formal system: by geometry, through physics or otherwise.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Asymmetric_%28PSF%29.svg/220px-Asymmetric_%28PSF%29.svg.png
