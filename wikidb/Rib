34.82	Rib	Rib	In vertebrate anatomy, ribs (Latin: ) are the long curved bones which form the rib cage. In most vertebrates, ribs surround the chest, enabling the lungs to expand and thus facilitate breathing by expanding the chest cavity. They serve to protect the lungs, heart, and other internal organs of the thorax. In some animals, especially snakes, ribs may provide support and protection for the entire body.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Image122.gif/150px-Image122.gif
