1.00	Iteration_X	Mage: The Ascension	Mage: The Ascension is a role-playing game based in the World of Darkness, and was published by White Wolf Game Studio. The characters portrayed in the game are referred to as mages, and are capable of feats of magic. The idea of magic in Mage is broadly inclusive of diverse ideas about mystical practices as well as other belief systems, such as science and religion, so that most mages do not resemble typical fantasy wizards.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/Mageasce_c.JPG
