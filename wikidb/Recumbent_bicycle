78.5	Recumbent_bicycle	Recumbent bicycle	A recumbent bicycle is a bicycle that places the rider in a laid-back reclining position. Most recumbent riders choose this type of design for ergonomic reasons; the rider's weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area, supported by back and buttocks. On a traditional upright bicycle, the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the sitting bones, the feet, and the hands.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Lightning_P38_RideXNC.jpg
