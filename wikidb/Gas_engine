8.13	Gas_engine	Gas engine	A gas engine is an internal combustion engine which runs on a gas fuel, such as coal gas, producer gas biogas, landfill gas or natural gas. In the UK, the term is unambiguous. In the US, due to the widespread use of "gas" as an abbreviation for gasoline, such an engine might also be called a gaseous fueled engine or natural gas engine.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/HartopGasEngineModel.JPG/220px-HartopGasEngineModel.JPG
