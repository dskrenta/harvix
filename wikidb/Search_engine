180.7	Search_engine	Web search engine	A web search engine is designed to search for information on the World Wide Web and FTP servers. The search results are generally presented in a list of results often referred to as SERPS, or "search engine results pages". The information may consist of web pages, images, information and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/WebCrawlerArchitecture.svg/280px-WebCrawlerArchitecture.svg.png
