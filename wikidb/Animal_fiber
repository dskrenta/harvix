8.01	Animal_fiber	Animal fiber	Animal fibers are natural fibers that consist largely of particular proteins. Instances are silk, hair/fur (including wool) and feathers. The animal fibers used most commonly both in the manufacturing world as well as by the hand spinners are wool from domestic sheep and silk. Also very popular are alpaca fiber and mohair from Angora goats. Unusual fibers such as Angora wool from rabbits and Chiengora from dogs also exist, but are rarely used for mass production.	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Kapok_seeds_I_IMG_8004.jpg/140px-Kapok_seeds_I_IMG_8004.jpg
